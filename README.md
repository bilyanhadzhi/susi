# SUSI
Student information system app for FMI's Object-oriented Programming course.

## Idea
SUSI is a command-line application that is centered around keeping information about students, the courses they're in, and their grades.

## Doxygen
Doxygen documentation can be found in the `html` folder for a closer look at the code.

## Running
The app was built on Linux and is most-easily run there.
Just do `build/susi`.
